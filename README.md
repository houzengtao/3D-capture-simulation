An orthopedic 3D motion capture and simulation system is developed by using NDI's optical capture instrument and C + +. 
The visual optical capture module is produced by NDI company. The measurement accuracy can reach 0.3 mm and the rate is 60 frames per second.
The data of pressure sensor and torque sensor are transferred to digital display card by software.
Using the usb5935 of Altay company. The measurement accuracy is 0.1%.
Using the collected data, the virtual joint 3D motion is realized by OpenGL programming.
